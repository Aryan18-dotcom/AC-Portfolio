🎯 Purpose

This portfolio is not just a website; it’s a representation of my personality, creativity, skill set, and growth as a developer. My goal was to create a portfolio that feels alive, interactive, and expressive—something that stands out from typical static resume-style websites. It is built to evolve over time as I grow my skills, add more projects, and refine my craft.
